## What is Kraitora
Kraitora is a game deployment tool designed for use on Panda3D.

Kraitora is based on some in house tools used by Toontown Rewritten,
during its release until June 2016.

Kraitora's purpose is to help developers of Indie Panda3D games,
deploy their games relatively quickly at the cost of security.

Kraitora is based on Freeze which essentially "zips" all your code
together into one file. You have to still bundle a version of python
and all c++ libraries.
