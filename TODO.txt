The Road to Fantasy:

    Phase 1 - The Presentability Versions:

        + Make Shtiker Book, Friends List, etc. accessible during battle but grey out the button so people can't flee.
        + Make an Advanced Custom Controls Menu with Controller Options
        + Figure out how to make NPCs do emotes during Toontask Dialog
        + Reimplement all missing features from Open-Toontown
        + Using the Fantasy-Launcher, create an update checker for Open-Fantasy
        + Create an in-game launcher like ODS using the Anesidora files that boots you into the game!
        + Figure out how to give Jellybeans and items for completing Toontasks, 
        + Add a new tab under Quests for Side Quests and Daily Quests.
        + Add an Inventory Page to the Shtiker Book where you can look at your Gags, Suit, Avatar, Enter Codes, etc.
        + Experience/Leveling System like TTCCs

        + Have SirDapperPenguin beggin replacing all 2D Models with 3D versions of themselves.

        + Finish working on the leveling system for THE R0YAL B0T.
        + Patch all Open-Toontown, Open-Fantasy, & TTO Bugs there are to be patched

    + Goal: To show off Toontown Fantasy at the First ever PLAYER ZER0 STUDIOS Gaming Showcase AND to release the demo for Toontown Fantasy to attract people to helping out with Toontown Fantasy

    Phase 2 - The Overhaul Versions:

        + Create a playable Opening Toontorial like ODS but done my way: Outside of Toontown in a kingdom, things are going well and you are introduced to the main character who has weird magical abilities that you can use. Once you've gone through that, you hear a bell ringing outside the castle and you run to look. You see Cogs marching up the path toward the castle. They are damaging property and so you run outside to protect your servants. You are introduced to some real-time fighting mechanics where you fight off cogs in a similar fashion to TTR's Doomsday. Wave after wave, you push back the Cogs as you help your people escape from the Cogs. Once your people escape, you go to the only sancuary left in the world, the Toontown Playgrounds to begin work for the Toontown Resistance.
        + Have SirDapperPenguin & any other modelers begin overhauling the playgrounds and their buildings.
        + Continue working on the new storyline with any help we have at that time.
        + Have Darth and any other helpers to implement Testing Keys to give away once people have reached Level 25 according to THE R0YAL B0T!
        + Begin working on the more indepth Character Creation Menus.

    + Goal: To begin Alpha Testing Toontown Fantasy.
