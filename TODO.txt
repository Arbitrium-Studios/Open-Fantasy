The Road to Fantasy:

    Phase 1 - The Presentability Versions:

        + Make Shtiker Book, Friends List, etc. accessible during battle but grey out the button so people can't flee.
        + Make an Advanced Custom Controls Menu with Controller Options
        + Figure out how to make NPCs do emotes during Toontask Dialog
        + Reimplement all missing features from Open-Toontown
        + Using the Fantasy-Launcher, create an update checker for Open-Fantasy
        + Create an in-game launcher like ODS using the Anesidora files that boots you into the game!
        + Figure out how to give Jellybeans and items for completing Toontasks, 
        + Add a new tab under Quests for Side Quests and Daily Quests.
        + Add an Inventory Page to the Shtiker Book where you can look at your Gags, Suit, Avatar, Enter Codes, etc.
        + Experience/Leveling System like TTCCs
        + Begin working on the custom Storyline myself.
        + Have SirDapperPenguin beggin replacing all 2D Models with 3D versions of themselves.
        + Have Darth begin working on the Realistic Shaders Option.
        + Finish working on the leveling system for THE R0YAL B0T.
        + Patch all Open-Toontown, Open-Fantasy, & TTO Bugs there are to be patched

    + Goal: To show off Toontown Fantasy at the First ever PLAYER ZER0 STUDIOS Gaming Showcase AND to release the demo for Toontown Fantasy to attract people to helping out with Toontown Fantasy

    Phase 2 - The Overhaul Versions:

        + Create a playable Opening Toontorial like ODS but done my way: Outside of Toontown in a kingdom, things are going well and you are introduced to the main character who has weird magical abilities that you can use. Once you've gone through that, you hear a bell ringing outside the castle and you run to look. You see Cogs marching up the path toward the castle. They are damaging property and so you run outside to protect your servants. You are introduced to some real-time fighting mechanics where you fight off cogs in a similar fashion to TTR's Doomsday. Wave after wave, you push back the Cogs as you help your people escape from the Cogs. Once your people escape, you go to the only sancuary left in the world, the Toontown Playgrounds to begin work for the Toontown Resistance.
        + Have SirDapperPenguin & any other modelers begin overhauling the playgrounds and their buildings.
        + Continue working on the new storyline with any help we have at that time.
        + Have Darth and any other helpers to implement Testing Keys to give away once people have reached Level 25 according to THE R0YAL B0T!
        + Begin working on the more indepth Character Creation Menus.

    + Goal: To begin Alpha Testing Toontown Fantasy.

                + Adds new music for each Floor specific to each department of COGS Incorporated.
                + Each floor should have a specific lay out to it.
                    + Floor 1: the entrance of a building with a Receptionist Cog to defeat before more, regular Cogs come out of the elevator.
                + The Eyes outside of the building move around to show the building is alive.
                + The Boss Cog should be a Head Honcho Manager Cog
                + The Boss Cog can cheat to summon more Cogs to the Battle. So, it's wise to focus on it.
            + A Field Office Update:
                + Like in TTR, the Field Office will take over the Toon Headquarters but with a model like Toontown Online's Field Offices BUT exclusively on higher-level streets!
                + Unlike in TTR, the final floor should be the Executive Suite with Head Honchos and Executive Cogs
                + Like TTO, there will be a Mover and Shaker Game and the Lawbot Flying Game but unlike TTO, it'll be in the same building.
                + Unlike Toontown Online and Toontown Rewritten, the side of the building you're on is Deparment Specific. You will be able to tell via a banner.
                + There should be new music created for each of these floors, specific to the Field Office you're in.
                + Depending on which side you go into, you can either get the Mega-Mover Mini-Game and a Real-Time Pie Round, a Craning Mini-Game and a Gooning Maze, a Cannon Mini-Game or a the Flying Legal Eagle Mini-Game from TTO, or a Real-Time Golf Mini-Game.
                + You should start with a Cog round, then go onto a Mini-Game that's randomly chosen unless you have a Toontask for a specific Mini-Game, then onto another Cog Round, then onto the Boss round.
                + Like in TTR, you should start with limited Gags.
                    + For each Mini-Game, you collect Jokes to get back at least 2 Gag Tracks per floor and Laff.
                + The reward for the Field Office should be a 6 Star SOS Cards that insta-kills your Cogs, a Training Point that you can redeem at the Cottage in Mount Acorn, and a discount on Potions because you saved the Witch of the Mountains.
            + A Vice President Boss Battle Update:
                + The higher level Cog your suit is, the harder the battle is.
                + The battle starts off easy and gets progressively harder as you defeat more cogs.
                + SOS Card's should function like Corporate Clash's SOS Cards.
            + The Overclocked Chief Executive Officer President Boss Battle
            + A Chief Financial Officer Boss Battle Update:
                + The Craning round should be pushed back for a second Cog Round.
                + You should get multiple varying types of Unite Rewards for this.
            + A Chief Justice Boss Battle Update:
                + This update gives you multiple rewards per Boss Run
                + To make it worth while, the reward should allow you to Summon a Cog Mid-Battle to Heal you or Attack for a specific number of rounds.
        + Cog Attacks should have the ability to do Damage Over Time.
        + You should be able to pick your Boss Rewards with your Gags. The only time you forfeit your ability to pick a gag is when you use a Doodle.
            + A Chief Executive Officer Boss Battle Update:
                + This makes it so the Boss Battle itself functions like Toontown Rewritten's Boss Battle.
                + You should get Multiple Fires.
        + If you try to use a Fire on Executive or Manager Cogs, they should dodge it and use a cheat that lowers the accuracy of the Toon's Gags for a couple of Rounds.
        + A Chat Overhaul Update:
            + Replace the whitelist with a Blacklist
                    + Use a modified version of Profanity Filter that checks for not allowed words.
                    + If a word is said that isn't allowed, a report should automatically be filed and it should be censored.
            + When we do the Blacklist update for the chat, I want to implement this chat menu for Type Chat from Toontown Online's Beta that you can type into. And use the Arrow button to switch to the OG chat system found here: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775528646349815817/994805297736585246/TTO_Beta_Chat.jpg
            + Speedchat should still be accessible by keeping the 2013 TTO chat layout.
            + The chat system should send your message in your set Speedchat color.
            + To add onto the Customizability the game offers, in your Shtiker Book, there should be an Arrow Button that opens up to reveal an Advanced Color Chooser that you can choose between Hexidecimal and others just like the Create-A-Toon's Choose Your Color Menu.
        + A Battle Overhaul:
            + Adds Ranged Gag Track
            + Adds my own take on the Zap gag track.
            + When using Squirt, it adds Soaked Disadvantage to the Cog used on which may cause it to short circuit and miss a round, increase Toon Accuracy for a couple of rounds, and it will boost Zap damage.
            + This update overhauls the Battle Gui to be
            + Adds the Magic System
                + Adds Magic to the new Battle Sub-Menu in the Shtiker Book.
                + More on this later.
            + Adds a new area called Mount Acorn you can access through the Abandoned Tunnel in Acorn Acres
        + During the late game, there should be Overclocked Bosses
            + The reason you've never heard of the Overclocked Boss in-universe is that, after you defeat a Sellbot Field Office, you collect a note that begins talking about Project: Overclock but it doesn't reveal to much. So, you must do more of the Sellbot Field Offices to retrieve more of the notes.
            + When you first go into the Overclocked Vice President, he instantly tells that you're a Toon and makes you go sad instantly. This has a one-time benefit though that you collect a piece of paper that tells of a Magical Witch on the outskirts of Acorn Acres
        + Achievements are a must soon!
        + A system where if you go Sad during a fight, you can press a button to return to the battle.
        + Revamp the Cog Heads and Suits.
        + Add a Experience Bar
            + Increase Max Laff amount to 145
            + Remove Film Strips from the Game and replace it with Training Points that you earn every 5 levels.
            + Remove Laff Point Toontasks and replace them with Laff Points gained every 5 levels but keep
        + Overhaul the Shtiker Book Pages:
            + The Options and the Extra Options Tabs should be merged together.
                + Because the Options will take up more than one page, use the Scroll Bar from the Custom Controls Menu to scroll down.
            + Remove the Gag Training Page
            + Overhaul the Gags Page
                + Add your Jellybean Total from the Toontown Bank and your Jellybean Bank (together) underneath the Jellybean Jar total.
                + Add the text Training Points and the amount of Training Points you have under the Total Gags and it's amount.
            + Merge the Gags, and the Cog Gallery into one page called Inventory
            + Merge Fishing Page, Kart Racing, Gardening Page, the Achievements Page (when we add it), and the Golf Page into one page called Activities
            + Regarding the District Page:
                + When booting up the game (Singleplayer), there should always be 2 Districts.
                    + Nutty River - Constant Invasions but checks your Toontasks to see if you need a specific Cog and ends then begins invasions based on that, it is represented by the Cog Madellion found in the Shtiker Book next to the Population Icon.
                    + Toon Valley - A normal District that can get a random invasion every once in a while.
                    + Thwackville - A district with no invasions, represented by a safe.
                + When you hover over a District, it should let you know if there are any invasions going on within the district.
            + Revamp the Cog Gallery
                + It shows the health
                + When hovering over a Cog Head, it should show you a basic overlay of what the Cog is and what it does.
                + When clicking a Cog Head, it should show a full suited version of the Cog.
                + When clicking over a Cog, it shows you the Attacks used on your Toon by that Cog.
                + You should be able to click on an attack listed and it will play the animation for the attack.
            + Redraw the Suit Parts.
                + Each suit part should be colored with the department's Suit color.
        + Remove Toontask Carry Limit
            + Shrink the Toontask Scroll Image to match Test Toontown
            + Add 2 more Scrolls to the top of the ToonTasks Page like Test Toontown

        + Merge ~MaxToon and ~Unlocks together.
        + Add Sleep Commands.
        + Add a version of the Toontown Rewritten Silly Meter Update
            + The Silly Meter should have an adaptable Build Up depending on who is online to make it easier or harder to adapt to the people online.
            + There should be a Taskline to fix it and it should stay fixed.
            + Instead of Silly Meter Teams, the followering should happen ALL at once:
                + Gardening Speed is Boosted
                + Global Toontown Teleportation
                + Double Racing Tickets
                + Decreased Fishing Rarity
                + Boosted Activity, Department, Gag Experience
                + Boosted Toon Attack Accuracy
                + Higher Chance of Dodging attacks
                + Toon's Walking, Sprinting, and Animation Speeds are all slightly boosted.
        + Right before your Toon falls asleep, your Toon should yawn, like on Toontown: Corporate Clash, but for Open-Fantasy, your Toon puts their hands behind their head in a stretch, the front of the feet lift up like they're reaching, their eyes should slowly close before they fall asleep.
        + We should do a contest for the addition of more Megaphone Jokes.
            + If a Megaphone Joke misses, the Cogs should laugh and the other Toons should half-heartedly laugh.
            + When you choose a Toon-Up Gag in battle and no other Toons are there, a random NPC should be called into battle to do the Toon-Up on you.
        + For Moderators, there should be a page in your Shtiker Book that appears
        + The Short Change should have a short body like on Toontown: Corporate Clash
        + The Micromanager should be Microsized like on Toontown: Corporate Clash
        + Create a tool to make it easy to add Quests to playgrounds like what Toontown Infinite had created for it by Joshsora.
            + This tool should also allow for us to add Animations and Emotes to match Dialog.
        + Implement my version of Toontown Relived NPC Toon Menu but using the Toon Menu used in-game.
        + Make Knock Knock Doors heal you on the Street, giving there to be a reason to use the doors.
        + Add the Silly Meter back into Toon Hall but don't take it out for repairs, just leave it not functional.
        + Make the instruments in The Land of Music playable when you step on them.
        + Make the text spoken in DDL, thought bubbles.
        + Model Overhaul Update:
            + Remake the Treasure Icons in 3D like what Corporate Clash did.
            + Remodel the Street Lamps

                + Redraw the Street Sign Textures without the Classic Character's Heads.
                + Make the Pointers 3D
            + Remake the Fences to be 3D
        + Re-rig the doors in Donald's Dreamland to better work with their models.
        + When rewriting the taskline, give each Toon their own personality. Flippy is patriotic, Coach Zucchini is well...that should be pretty obvious, and more!
        + Make the Dialog for Toontasks continue after about 30 seconds while still allowing slow readers to read.
            + This should make it easy to add voice acting over it if we decide to do so.

        + More soon!
