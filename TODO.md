            > Unlike in TTR, the final floor should be the Executive Suite with Head Honchos and Executive Cogs
            > Like TTO, there will be a Mover and Shaker Game and the Lawbot Flying Game but unlike TTO, it'll be in the same building.
            > Unlike Toontown Online and Toontown Rewritten, the side of the building you're on is Deparment Specific. You will be able to tell via a banner.

            > Depending on which side you go into, you can either get the Mega-Mover Mini-Game and a Real-Time Pie Round, a Craning Mini-Game and a Gooning Maze, a Cannon Mini-Game or a the Flying Legal Eagle Mini-Game from TTO, or a Real-Time Golf Mini-Game.

            > This makes it so the Boss Battle itself functions like Toontown Rewritten's Boss Battle.
            > You should get Multiple Fires.

    > A Chat Overhaul Update:
        > Replace the whitelist with a Blacklist
                > Use a modified version of Profanity Filter that checks for not allowed words.
                > If a word is said that isn't allowed, a report should automatically be filed and it should be censored.
        > When we do the Blacklist update for the chat, I want to implement this chat menu for Type Chat from Toontown Online's Beta that you can type into. And use the Arrow button to switch to the OG chat system found here: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775528646349815817/994805297736585246/TTO_Beta_Chat.jpg

        > The chat system should send your message in your set Speedchat color.
        > To add onto the Customizability the game offers, in your Shtiker Book, there should be an Arrow Button that opens up to reveal an Advanced Color Chooser that you can choose between Hexidecimal and others just like the Create-A-Toon's Choose Your Color Menu.
    > A Battle Overhaul:
        > Adds Ranged Gag Track
        > Adds my own take on the Zap gag track.
        > When using Squirt, it adds Soaked Disadvantage to the Cog used on which may cause it to short circuit and miss a round, increase Toon Accuracy for a couple of rounds, and it will boost Zap damage.

        > Adds a new area called Mount Acorn you can access through the Abandoned Tunnel in Acorn Acres
    > During the late game, there should be Overclocked Bosses
        > The reason you've never heard of the Overclocked Boss in-universe is that, after you defeat a Sellbot Field Office, you collect a note that begins talking about Project: Overclock but it doesn't reveal to much. So, you must do more of the Sellbot Field Offices to retrieve more of the notes.
        > When you first go into the Overclocked Vice President, he instantly tells that you're a Toon and makes you go sad instantly. This has a one-time benefit though that you collect a piece of paper that tells of a Magical Witch on the outskirts of Acorn Acres

        > Remove the Gag Training Page
        > Overhaul the Gags Page
            > Add your Jellybean Total from the Toontown Bank and your Jellybean Bank (together) underneath the Jellybean Jar total.

        > Add a Statistics Page
        > Regarding the District Page:
            > When booting up the game (Singleplayer), there should always be 2 Districts.
                > Nutty River - Constant Invasions but checks your Toontasks to see if you need a specific Cog and ends then begins invasions based on that, it is represented by the Cog Madellion found in the Shtiker Book next to the Population Icon.
                > Toon Valley - A normal District that can get a random invasion every once in a while.
                > Thwackville - A district with no invasions, represented by a safe.
            > When you hover over a District, it should let you know if there are any invasions going on within the district.
        > Revamp the Cog Gallery
            > It shows the health
            > When hovering over a Cog Head, it should show you a basic overlay of what the Cog is and what it does.
            > When clicking a Cog Head, it should show a full suited version of the Cog.
            > When clicking over a Cog, it shows you the Attacks used on your Toon by that Cog.
            > You should be able to click on an attack listed and it will play the animation for the attack.
        > Redraw the Suit Parts.
            > Each suit part should be colored with the department's Suit color.
    > Remove Toontask Carry Limit

        > There should be a Taskline to fix it and it should stay fixed.
        > Instead of Silly Meter Teams, the followering should happen ALL at once:
            > Gardening Speed is Boosted
            > Global Toontown Teleportation
            > Double Racing Tickets
            > Decreased Fishing Rarity

            > Boosted Toon Attack Accuracy
            > Higher Chance of Dodging attacks
            > Toon's Walking, Sprinting, and Animation Speeds are all slightly boosted.
    > Right before your Toon falls asleep, your Toon should yawn, like on Toontown: Corporate Clash, but for Open-Fantasy, your Toon puts their hands behind their head in a stretch, the front of the feet lift up like they're reaching, their eyes should slowly close before they fall asleep.
    > We should do a contest for the addition of more Megaphone Jokes.
        > If a Megaphone Joke misses, the Cogs should laugh and the other Toons should half-heartedly laugh.
        > When you choose a Toon-Up Gag in battle and no other Toons are there, a random NPC should be called into battle to do the Toon-Up on you.

        > Remake the Fences to be 3D
    > Re-rig the doors in Donald's Dreamland to better work with their models.
