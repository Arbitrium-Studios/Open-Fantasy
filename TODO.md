An Estate Update which does a complete overhaul to the current estate by...:

+ adding new houses for new Toons
+ your other Toons wandering around and communicating with one another
+ with your Toon with clickable nametags to view information about that specific Toon
+ a couple of streets that could lead to areas such as a Doodle park, a store where you can buy fertilizer and other items
+ The fisherman or fisherwoman in your estate has his/her own home inside the estate.
+ on top of having a fisherman/fisherwoman in your estate, your Doodle could eat the fish for you for higher affection levels and less hunger levels (could perhaps be added in a Doodle Update)
* fences or walls around the back of the houses (so like the castle has brick walled-fence, the cabin has a wooden fence, etc.),
* a new house as a default house like what Disney was going to do before they added the current default house model as a placeholder
+ stone plots to plant stone statues in front of your house instead of flowers.
+ more plots to have a larger garden and more organic gags to make the game easier for both maxing watering can and for completing the game
+ on/off light switches or candles for each room (depending on the house type.)
+ a working tv that can be turned on/off and the volume can be adjusted and this comes with custom made animations just for this game but can also have already loaded in mp4 files.
+ a jukebox outside of the estate that loads Toontown Music and can load MP3s 
+ A street that connects the estates to the rest of Toontown (like in the Funny Farm area (if we add that)) but if you and your friend enter the street leading to the estates, your friend will comes out of the tunnel in his/her own estate but not the same area as your Toon unless you teleport to your friend.
+ add picnic tables
- fix the target game in the estate so it acts like its counterpart the cannon game in parties but it still Toons you up for every time you hit the target (the target also acts like the clouds except it heals you whenever you hit it.)
* more items for the catalog thus more pages for the catalog.
+ Add the ability to sleep in your bed and once your Toon wakes up, (s)he gains a specific boost of their choosing once they wake up and (s)he has slept for a specific amount of time.
+ Add a working jetpack from the catalog that lets you fly in the air for a specific amount of time
+ add a multi-kart garage for each your karts
+ add a sprinkler system that you can turn on and your plants will automatically be watered for you but might or might not receive XP for it (that would have to be discussed)
- remove the feature that you have to plant a Silver Jellybean to plant a statue that you already paid for
+ Edible Food that gives you boosts when you eat them.
+ Sitting on the chair or the couch in your estate or around Toontown for a set amount of time can give you a speed boost for a limited amount of time.
+ Two people can sit on the regular couch
- three people can sit on the hay couch or one person can lay on it.
+ only one person can sit on the chair at a time
+ one person can lay or sit on the bed at a time
+ Flint and Steel can be bought from the catalog to light up a campfire outside, to light the candles, and to light the fireplace in your house and the flame will wither out and die after a while
* fireplaces should be built into each house and not separate
+ Estate Upgrades for if you want to add more stories to a house and what not instead of buying a new house.
+ Estate Upgrades take time to add onto the house, the bigger they are, the longer it takes
* Whenever you buy a new house, it takes anywhere from a day to a week to completely build the new house since you are replacing your previous house
+ Lit candles gives off its own light, just like the fireplace and the campfire
+ Whenever you sleep or sit down, it should auto-activate a more restricted version of the oobe command (which means you can move your camera around but only above and around your Toon but it cannot move beneath the bed, beneath the floor, through the ceiling, through the wall, etc.) so it’s not at an * uncomfortable*  angle whenever your Toon sleeps.
- AFK gets turned off whenever your Toon is in bed because your Toon is already sleeping.
- Whenever your Toon goes to sleep, your Toon teleports to his/her estate and goes into the house and hops onto the bed and sleeps but you won’t be logged out of your Toon anymore and whenever you’re ready to come back to your Toon, all you have to do is click or tap the exit button on your screen and you’re ready to get back in action but you can still exit to Pick-A-Toon screen using your Schticker Book.
+ Items like Flags can be hung in the corner of the house that touch the two corners of your Toon’s house
+ You can move items outside like in ODS
+ Bungalow Houses with interiors that look like Bungalow Houses but are bigger on the inside...
+ Tiki Houses with interiors that look like Tikis but are larger on the inside
~ Make the estates useful in the game and give them the original scrapped sound track found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_k_F49rYCo/ (slowed down a bit) and here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bTSXCdmLkw/
+ XP for Watering and Shoveling should match what level your watering can or shovel is at.
+ During the winter, give the option to shovel the path around your house for x amount of Shoveling XP (x = current level of shovel)
More to be added...
+ Allow us to see outside of our window in Estate

~ Updating the Friends List GUI for easier navigation
~ Updating the Profile GUI of the Toon you click on.
~ Increasing the maximum number of friends you can have without lagging the game client.
~ Making the Friends button smaller for more screens to further enhance the already immersed game.

The ChitChat Update which overhauls the Chat System by doing the following to the game...:

~ allowing you to say anything unless it’s specifically blacklisted… (please, it makes so much more sense compared to the current system!)
~ Reworking the True Friends System so that you don’t have to rely on Discord or irl social interactions to share a True Friends Code or completely removing True Friends all together.
+ Adding back the Chat GUI that was shown in an Alpha or Beta version of Toontown Online except directly above it is a Chat Log that can be hidden and the opacity of the Chat Log AND the Chat Menu are changeable in the Shticker Book
+ Adding the ability to use in-game emojis instead of typing the emote yourself and using an Emoji also triggers an animation to be played that coincides with the emote being used and the emoji button is found on the left of both the Speedchat Button and the Chat Button.

Adding The Advanced Update to make the following changes to the game...:

+ A more diverse, unique, and advanced option/variety of clothes, accessories, etc. including long and short dresses, jumpsuits, capris, more realistic shorts, different types of shorts, pants, crop-top shirts, various lengths of shorts, and more!
+ Some accessories and clothing will give you boosts in specific areas and will not just be for the looks like Toontown Relived did.
+ New Animations to the game like the T-Pose Animation and more (I couldn’t think of more animations off of the top of my head.)
+ Have the Resistance Salute (“Toons of the World, Unite!”) actually do something in the game instead of it just being there.

+ The ability to equip Cheesy Effects in your shticker book that you have unlocked through Toontasks.
+ Add species pros and cons for a more strategic create-a-toon process

Adding The Stadium Update changes the game in the following ways...:

~ Blizzard Boulevard would get its own area in the Racing Section since it could easily become its own race track.
~ Fixing Racing
~ Fixing Golfing
+ Adds Toon Island Stadium as a massive playground split into various areas through tunnels that leads to the specific area you want to go to.
+ All mini-games (Racing, Golfing, regular table games, even the Trolley, and the Party Station get their own areas, plus and new games such as volleyball, dodgeball, TvT (which is Toon versus Toon), Reversed Battle Royale, Toon Tag, etc....) are readded into the game from TTO with the original content and new content added back.
+ Each Mini-game has its own designated area that’s colored in its own set of colors.
+ In the Racing Area, there are two sections: the usual layouts for races on the sides plus more and another area for Street Racing.
+ Street Racing is exactly that what it sounds like... It’s street racing but it’s around a custom made street that’s designed after one of the original playgrounds in TTO.
+ In the center of the designated area for racing, there is a Kart Shop where you can buy a Kart, color, and accessories for the Kart
+ Specific Accessories (i.e. a Muffler, a spoiler, etc.) would give your Toon perks in an actual Race however these buffs aren’t by much so it’s not that unfair.
+ Doodle Racing where you race Doodles with other Toons or with an AI or multiple AI.
+ You’d be able to take out your Kart at any time in the game to get to places faster.
+ In the Golfing Area, there is another split one that gives you Mini-Golf and the other gives you actual Golf.
+ In the center of the two areas, there is a shop where you would buy golf clubs with different perks and different colored Golf Balls.
+ In the center of the main area in the playground, there is a pillar with a staircase leading up to a windowed viewing area where if you walk up to the binoculars aimed at each specific area for each mini-game, you can view someone doing that mini-game. If there are multiple people doing the same mini-game, a menu would pop up asking who would like to view race or golf or play a game and once you pick, you automatically view it as a spectator.
+ There is also a mini gift shop in the Viewing Tower tucked away in a corner where a Toon is behind the counter in a small room and there you can buy clothing items you normally wouldn’t be able to get anywhere else and the items would rotate every week or so. (If it runs out of things to sell, it will cycle back to the first one that it has and the new one won’t be shown until it cycles to the newest issue.)
+ Each Trophy you win in each mini-game, you can display at your estate within a Trophy Case which can be bought from the catalog.
+ TvT would have its own area where you would try to Green the other Toon or Toons and try to be the last one standing.
+ A Reversed Battle Royale is where your Toon and 7 to 14 others start out at 1 Laff and must heal themselves to a randomized Laff between 70 and whatever the max Laff is. You can find loot boxes that either give you a randomized amount of Laff, can cause you to lose Laff, automatically be disqualified from the match, give you an item that causes anywhere from one to the seven other Toons to lose a specific amount of Laff. Meanwhile, random heals are popping up all over the map. Oh, and the map randomizes each time you play.
+ Player Titles that can be displayed on the MiniGames Page in your Shticker Book and it will show up underneath your Toon’s name within the name tag for other Toons to see (it’s kind of like what ODS has for equipping achievements.)
+ Another part would be a recreation of the original Toon Tag from back in Disney’s Virtual Reality set found before TTO began production but instead of playing as Disney Characters, you play as your own Toon.
+ Boarding Groups for each activity can be made.
+ If there are not enough players who will play with you on a specific mini-game, you will still be able to go in but instead of another person going up against you, it’s an AI who is sent in as a stand in for the other players portrayed as a regular Toon. (it would be an easy enough win if you are playing correctly) This way you can still receive trophies and extra Laff points for racing or golfing or whatever even if you don’t have anybody else, thus diminishing the need for an alternative account to play by yourself.
+ Each Mini-game could have its own leveling system or else it’s just one big leveling system.
+ The trolley games and other mini-games that have an AI Toon should become more difficult depending on how well you are doing in said mini-game or trolley game and it would be the next game or mini-game’s difficulty off of that.
+ Crane Game Trolley Game where you have to use a crane to pick up a Cog and drop them onto each other or into lava to protect Laff Barrels that way we can practice using the Crane before we get to the CFO.
+ Add a Fashion Show game that you participate in to show off your clothing and get judged for it while you go head-to-head against other Toons or AI who are trying to win.
+ Add Skip button to the Trolley mini-games

Add an update titled The Purchasing Update that overhauls multiple sections of the game including but not limited to Clothing, Money, The Catalog, and more by adding the following changes:

~ Use Jellybeans to buy clothing items instead of just having a clothing ticket.
+ Adding multiple forms of purchasing capabilities near the end of the main story like using Jelly Card, a lighter and simpler way to hold your Jellybeans
+ Add the bank building model from TTI and be able to open an account to use a Jelly Card and you can just pull jellybeans from the bank into your Jar.
+ Add an up and down arrow and scrolling mechanics for phrases that go off screen to accommodate for the lack of the limits on custom phrases that you can buy

The Cloth Update will include:

~ Fix the individual Feathered Clothes Textures so that the shorts line up with the shirt
+ The ability to give items like Tops and Bottoms to your friends or to a random Toon who wants it and has it on their wishlist.
+ Add an in-game wishlist to TTMC so that others with the jellybeans needed, may give the item to a random Toon on the list for Toons who want that specific item.
+ Add Dresses and Jumpsuits to the game.
~ the Plain colored clothes from Create-A-Toon screen and make them into same color dresses.
+ Have the individual plain colored clothes buyable from the catalog or the Clothing Store.
+ Make the Clothing Store look like an actual Clothing Store with racks of different clothes and a round table with skirts, a higher-up rack for dresses, shelves for shirts that are folded, with the Tailor behind a desk to fit the clothes just for you for enough Jellybeans, and a curtain with a room behind it so that you can try on clothes you want and when you’re done, you either buy it or put it back.
+ Add Customizable Clothing Items where you can customize your own clothes and sleeves with a color palette, textures from the phase files, decals you collect from around Toon Island and maybe around Toontown and maybe even upload your own textures and decals for your own Toon’s eyes to see but not to everybody else’s (since they will see randomized clothing items on your body since they would be uploaded locally and not on the cloud or wherever the server is located.)
+ Clothing and accessory Items that represent Pride that comes out during Pride Month and stays during Pride Month and doesn’t come back until the beginning of the same month, the next year.
+ Add the ability to sell a clothing item or accessory to earn Jellybeans
+ Make Clothing Shops sell clothes and accessories that match the playground that they are situated in.
- Add dresses for the females and jumpsuits for the males and merge some of the textures like the sound shirt and pants and the plain shirt and skirt into one to lessen the amount of shirts/skirts/pants that are separate while adding new content and making the textures that look like one piece actually be one piece.
+ A clothing line that comes out during Pride Month for all of those Toons with Pride including but not limited to dresses, skirts, shorts, shirts, shoes, bows, bowties, backpacks, socks, glasses, and whatnot.

+ Long-sleeved shirts --Bloxicon
+ Long-sleeved pants/jeans --Bloxicon
+ Hoodies --Bloxicon
+ perhaps there could be a toggleable shirt overlay (one that makes the shirt look tucked in, one that makes it look like it goes over the shorts or skirt or whatever) -- Scott/Froge/Anne
+ Add the ability to pick your default accessories like what Toontown House did in the Clothes shop in the Create-A-Toon screen (not the in-game clothing shop) --Zachary
+ Addon ability to change all of your toon, possibly replacing clothing shop --Hunter
+ some accessories can give you minor buffs like slightly boosted gag accuracy or damage, perhaps even decreased damage taken from cogs --Scott/Froge/Anne
+ More types of gloves. You could either wear something more fancy when attending a ritzy party, choose more beat-up gloves for a hobo aesthetic, or even just go gloveless. -- Bloxicon
+ A way to give unwanted clothes to other toons like we could say we can give the shirt, pants/skirt, dress/jumpsuit to a friend or to a random person in the game that wants it.
+ Maybe by having an in-game Wishlist for specific items that you want and somebody could gift it to you if they want to by either buying it or giving their own clothes to that person or persons. -- Dontai and Zachary
+ Have perks for every type of clothing except for the plain clothing

+ Each Toon has the chance to attack a Cog naturally through Instinctual Attacks like, for example a Cat can scratch an enemy either dealing damage or making the enemy weaker, depending on the type of enemy or a horse can punch or kick an enemy, dealing damage. (This attack would be completely randomized during battle and could not be chosen as an attack by the player.)
+ Adding new Gags and Gag types to the Menu
The Construction Update: 
Use a new version of the concept for Construction Zone for this game’s Island because content...
You’d have to swing around on ropes and do parkour to get around in the playground and occasionally the streets to have new ways to play and the Cogs on the street would have to fly over gaps that fall into a river. 
Whenever you’d fall down, you’d get teleported back up to the last platform because of an explanation that could be given: A safety mechanism that causes a black hole to open beneath you and teleport you back up to the last platform.
In the playground, there would be a crane where you could climb up and then move the crane which has a rope in the crane and you’d be able to direct the crane to which platform you would need. 
There would also be NPC workers working around the playground. There would be two gag shop clerks outside because the gag shop is not built yet. 
There would be a piping area where your Toon could enter through a hole in the ground where you can find a massive Red Mole and regular mole problem that could be the center of a main story task or a side story task.

A Weather Update that changes the game in the following ways...:

+ Combined weather (like Rain and Hail)
+ Add an NPC Seer any Toon can visit that tells your Toon the Weather or add items to the Catalog that can predict the weather or add phones to the game that can tell you the weather...

The Catalog Update makes the Catalog Relevant again by doing the following to the game...:

+ You can change between the Catalog Types using a button on the screen

+ You can buy access to different types of catalogs and your Toon receives that new Catalog type the very next day and your Toon would get the next version of the Catalog on that same day, the next week.
+ Add a Clothing Category where you would buy Clothing for a randomized price however if it is on the catalog and in the Clothing Shop, it would not always be cheaper than buying it from the Clothing Shop.
+ Toon Rewrite

+ Add a Potions section in your Items Page in the Shticker Book
+ And why not have a Flesh-Skinned Alien running the shack that may be a Human that got stranded here.
+ Add a side quest that introduces the person as the Witch of the Mountain who is here to help the intrepid hero through a series of quests to see if you are worthy of her potions that will help you throughout many quests including through many main quests including through transforming your Toon into a Mermaid to go down to Atlantis to help out

+ And More

Others:

+ What if when a Toon goes sad, he/she can still stay in battle at the cost of their Gags only dealing 80% of their base damage? And after a single battle is cleared, all sad Toons receive an up to 20+  Laff boost.
+ We could also have a mechanic where ALL of them have to go sad for them to be kicked back to the playground. For example, if there are 3 Toons battling a Cog, he has to keep attacking them until all 3 Toons have no Laff points left. And in addition you can stay in battle and Toon-Up still works if people use it on you
+ Toon Clans
+ Gardening Overhaul.
+ The Ability to Choose whichever Trolley Game you want to play.
+ Add the sunken city of Penglantis to the game in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean

+ Make the house Cannon Game actually function like a party cannon game and not like it currently does.
+ Add a special gift to people who sit through the credits.
+ Allow us to scroll through the credits
+ Change the music in the credits to the Victory Theme v2
+ Boost trap damage so TNT kills 12 and Railroad kills 13.
+ Have the daffodil move up and down based on how many players are by it.
~ Move the spawn area of the HQ to a safe place instead of in the Cog's way.

The Infinity Tower:

+ The Infinity Tower is a 20 story Cog Building that uses experimental Quantum Technology to loop the Toon/Cog through an infinite number of 20 story tall Cog Buildings an infinite number of universes.
~ Remake all models and replace 2d models with 3d models and have the mouths move up and down to the sound effects or to the sound of the voice actor, and do that to Toons as well, redraw all 2D textures and make them HD and maybe even in 4K and have the ability to lower and raise the quality depending on the computer type you have and what you can handle, also redo all of the music and sound effects in order to make the game feel newer/fresher.
+ Featured Toontown meme of the month featured in the launcher.
~ A complete overhaul to the map and the map page so that the tunnels are in the correct place and so you can zoom in and zoom out of the map and click-to-drag the map so that we don't have to make more maps, it's just 1 large map that shows both the streets and the playground in great detail and can show where you and your friends are on the map, where your Toontask is located while patching the bug where you can teleport to the Minigolf area since it isn't classified as a playground because it isn't on the map, and whatnot.
You can open your map anywhere by pressing the 'm' key or by pressing alt on your keyboard and the map shows everywhere so that you don't have to open your Shtiker Book every time you want to view the map.
+ Add the ability to actually friend a Cog but it works like 0.01% of the time and when it does, your friend Cog can help you in battle but it can only happen as long as a another Cog doesn't see you otherwise, the Cog is killed by its fellow comrades because the Chairman ordered it.
+ Bring back Partners and add a feature on the launcher and the website where we can feature stories, videos, YouTube and Twitch channels, and possibly even other games in case the others don't like our game or are done with the game and want something else to do until the next piece of story/content is out in the game.
+ If a player cheats, don’t ban them yet. Force them to watch a video of your Toons being dipped in acid and then banning their account from anywhere between a termination to a Global ban (depending on how often they cheat and how much.)
~ Instead of defaulting to the arrow keys, make the character be moveable via both WASD keys and Arrow Keys, open/close the chat by pressing enter, (if we add it) press v for voice chat or voice to text chat, escape or F8/B  to open the Shtiker Book or Phone (depending on what we do), and so on but this would be by default. And of course you can add custom key binds to it.
This would match the keybinds to what PotCO’s keybinds were which make more sense than the arrow keys.
+ /~If we end up using unity instead of Panda3D, might I suggest a VR version Toontown: Market Crash where you can either use your controllers to move forward or you can teleport to a place and on other clients, it looks like you’re running.
+ Goose Species with an actual goose hjonking sound effect.
+ Sprocket Coins
You get sprocket coins from defeating cogs, the harder the cogs the more sprocket coins you get, this will be one of the main motives for the Infinite Tower as you’ll get more and more as you go along. This will create the effect as you go along less grind and more hard

You can then spend these coins on buffs, some ideas:

+ X movement speed Y time
+ X gag exp Y time
+ X gag accuracy Y time
- X cog damage Y time
- X cog accuracy Y time (single attacks only if targeted at you )
+ X jump boost Y time

Other buff ideas:

+ X Gag damage for Y time
- X Cog defense for Y time
+ X temporary Laff boost for Y time

Sprocket Coin Drop Rates:

Bronze =  20 +  (hood difficulty x 5) ; in TTC, the rate would be 25%
Silver = 10 +  (hood difficulty x 1.5) ; in MML, the rate would be 16%
Gold = 5 +  (hood difficulty x 0.25) : in DDL, the rate would be 6.5%
The amount for each sprocket is randomly chosen from (Cog level x 1) to (Cog level x 1.35 rounded down)
For example, a level 12 Cog would drop 12~16 of each sprocket.
Oops, I forgot one thing.

Starting from MML, the rarer sprocket coins will start to appear more often than the more common ones.
For example:

Bronze = 40 - (difficulty x 2.5) ; in an area with a difficulty of 8, the chance is 20%
Silver = 16 - (difficulty x 0.75) ; in an area with a difficulty of 8, the chance is 10%
Gold = 6 +  (difficulty x 1.5) ; in an area with a difficulty of 16, the chance is 30%
And you can either redeem them from your Shtiker Book or you can go all of the way to the Witch of the Mountain to redeem it there.
+ Have your Toon actually have the option to react and reply to the Toon/NPC they're talking to but have multiple options and have the dialog affect what the NPC says to make it feel even more like an MMORPG but add this feature like before the game releases to the public.
And then slide some Easter eggs in there...
A possible Easter Egg could happen whenever you're approaching Flippy for the first time outside of the Toontorial and this would utilize Multiverse Theory which is a real thing in the game because the Districts are separate universes, so maybe we could reference other Toontown games or Disney properties without directly mentioning them. -- Zachary & Scott/Froge/Anne
+ toon profiles that show toon id, gags, doodle, current tasks, laff, maybe even preferred pronouns? -- Scott/Froge/Anne
+ Challenge page in your book that has the daily and weekly tasks as well as permanent challenges that you can do as you progress through the game. Possibly giving you accessories, name tags, doodle accessories? Possibly even special houses? (Rewards are based on difficulty of the challenge, giving players something to work for besides laff and suits) -- Boomer
~ Toon Titties
+ Custom doodle stats (Which could cost more beans or something) could possibly only customize stats in the higher playgrounds
+ Use the leaked concepts from TTO’s beginning in our game -- Zachary
+ When you buy a doodle have the option to customize it like what you want. Be able to pick the ears eyes nose tail color pattern stripes. -- Tegan
+ Make fishing's rng less terrible. Since this isn't a subscription-based game like tto, we really shouldn't need to waste weeks, even months on rolling the dice and hoping we get those new species we need. Perhaps we could make fishing less rare, or come up with a whole new idea? -- Scott/Froge/Anne
+ If we actually end up doing human toons then we should have words recorded and uploaded to the cloud as an mp3 or ogg file and then we should develop an AI system that reads the words your Human Toon says and downloads the audio file of those words and put them together instead of using grunts and have two different audio types (aka male and female) for male and female Human Toons or just implement a voice chat ability for all species that could end up being moderated and if there's a bad word, have an ai automatically censor it or just don't censor it and the Toon can report the Toon for swearing on the vc or something like that. -- Zachary
+ Make our own Racoon Toons --Scott/Froge/Anne
+ Crab Toons -- Zachary
+ Skunk Toons -- Scott/Froge/Anne
+ When signing up to become a Resistance Ranger in Donald's Dreamland, on top of getting a salute, you also get custom Resistance Ranger clothes and accessories in the mail but instead of having you sign up, have it be a part of the taskline where you’re recruited for the Resistance? The stuff is sent in the mail and you go on to fight bigger cogs for later on in the taskline.
+ Talking animations.

Toon Tags Update:

+ Toon Tags so others know you’re the real deal or if you’re a fake -- Zachary
+ The ability to click on your own name tag to see your own Toon, Toon stats, gags, toontasks, and probably your own Toon Tag so you don’t have to rely on using another Toon to see it and tell you it. -- Zachary
~ Customizable Toon IDs (Hunter Boppen) but don’t allow people to create a Toontag that’s already taken by someone else. Like a first come first serve basis. -- Zachary
+ Shows who’s staff in the game. Could be a title below the name or a symbol above the name; or a symbol once you click the name tag. -- Revolution
+ Add the ability for the staff and streamers to hide their title or icon on other Toons so that you don’t attract any unwanted attention -- Zachary
~ Cold callers doing more damage in the Brrrgh. --Flame
+ Interactive furniture such as a playable piano -- Sir Fangar and Zachary
+ Cogs that turn their head and look at your Toon when they walk by like what’s in Toontown Frenchy
+ Mounts like hoverboards (Flame) or any mounts to get to places faster, even if it is as weak as driving your car down the street. -- Zachary
~ Easier suit promos, so like no more 7 back nines to get a promo -- C.E.O. Chief Peanut Butter
+ A museum for cogs with stats on how many of said cogs are defeated and also it should have Dinosaur Toon bones and extinct types of Toons as well as a Cog Display to really give it a museum vibe and on top of that, there are little documents that you can walk up to and press "read" to get some lore about that type of species and the museum should also have Top Toons in there and it should be playing the scrapped Museum theme ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIZf0zexKSQ ) as the interior music.
+ Dropped items that you find for defeating Cogs that you can sell to the Museum for Jellybeans that you can also view in your Shtiker Book how many items you have and of what kind.

The Pets Update:

    + Add Puffles
    + Replace Spam training with mini-game training with various mini-games that train one trick at a time like Wizard101
    + Type-A-Name for Doodles
    + Add a ton of new Pet Tricks

The Toon Tips Update:

+ Implement a new Toon Tip system that replaces the one on the loading screen
+ Have Toon Tips appear to you on the side of the screen and you can view ALL them in your Shtiker Book
- Remove Toon Tips from the loading screen
~ Replace loading screen with something interesting too look at.

            > Like TTO, there will be a Mover and Shaker Game and the Lawbot Flying Game but unlike TTO, it'll be in the same building.
            > Unlike Toontown Online and Toontown Rewritten, the side of the building you're on is Deparment Specific. You will be able to tell via a banner.
            > There should be new music created for each of these floors, specific to the Field Office you're in.

            > Like in TTR, you should start with limited Gags.
                > For each Mini-Game, you collect Jokes to get back at least 2 Gag Tracks per floor and Laff.
            > The reward for the Field Office should be a 6 Star SOS Cards that insta-kills your Cogs, a Training Point that you can redeem at the Cottage in Mount Acorn, and a discount on Potions because you saved the Witch of the Mountains.

    > You should be able to pick your Boss Rewards with your Gags. The only time you forfeit your ability to pick a gag is when you use a Pets.
        > A Chief Executive Officer Boss Battle Update:
            > This makes it so the Boss Battle itself functions like Toontown Rewritten's Boss Battle.
            > You should get Multiple Fires.
    > If you try to use a Fire on Executive or Manager Cogs, they should dodge it and use a cheat that lowers the accuracy of the Toon's Gags for a couple of Rounds.
    > A Chat Overhaul Update:
        > Replace the whitelist with a Blacklist
                > Use a modified version of Profanity Filter that checks for not allowed words.

        > When we do the Blacklist update for the chat, I want to implement this chat menu for Type Chat from Toontown Online's Beta that you can type into. And use the Arrow button to switch to the OG chat system found here: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775528646349815817/994805297736585246/TTO_Beta_Chat.jpg

        > The chat system should send your message in your set Speedchat color.
        > To add onto the Customizability the game offers, in your Shtiker Book, there should be an Arrow Button that opens up to reveal an Advanced Color Chooser that you can choose between Hexidecimal and others just like the Create-A-Toon's Choose Your Color Menu.
    > A Battle Overhaul:
        > Adds Ranged Gag Track
        > Adds my own take on the Zap gag track.
        > When using Squirt, it adds Soaked Disadvantage to the Cog used on which may cause it to short circuit and miss a round, increase Toon Accuracy for a couple of rounds, and it will boost Zap damage.

        > Adds the Magic System
            > Adds Magic to the new Battle Sub-Menu in the Shtiker Book.
            > More on this later.
        > Adds a new area called Mount Acorn you can access through the Abandoned Tunnel in Acorn Acres
    > During the late game, there should be Overclocked Bosses
        > The reason you've never heard of the Overclocked Boss in-universe is that, after you defeat a Sellbot Field Office, you collect a note that begins talking about Project: Overclock but it doesn't reveal to much. So, you must do more of the Sellbot Field Offices to retrieve more of the notes.
        > When you first go into the Overclocked Vice President, he instantly tells that you're a Toon and makes you go sad instantly. This has a one-time benefit though that you collect a piece of paper that tells of a Magical Witch on the outskirts of Acorn Acres

    > Revamp the Cog Heads and Suits.

        > Remove the Gag Training Page
        > Overhaul the Gags Page
            > Add your Jellybean Total from the Toontown Bank and your Jellybean Bank (together) underneath the Jellybean Jar total.

        > Regarding the District Page:
            > When booting up the game (Singleplayer), there should always be 2 Districts.
                > Nutty River - Constant Invasions but checks your Toontasks to see if you need a specific Cog and ends then begins invasions based on that, it is represented by the Cog Madellion found in the Shtiker Book next to the Population Icon.
                > Toon Valley - A normal District that can get a random invasion every once in a while.
                > Thwackville - A district with no invasions, represented by a safe.
            > When you hover over a District, it should let you know if there are any invasions going on within the district.
        > Revamp the Cog Gallery
            > It shows the health
            > When hovering over a Cog Head, it should show you a basic overlay of what the Cog is and what it does.
            > When clicking a Cog Head, it should show a full suited version of the Cog.
            > When clicking over a Cog, it shows you the Attacks used on your Toon by that Cog.
            > You should be able to click on an attack listed and it will play the animation for the attack.
        > Redraw the Suit Parts.
            > Each suit part should be colored with the department's Suit color.
    > Remove Toontask Carry Limit

    > If you're in an area that need to be updated, you can stay in it and it'll be refreshed when it's downloaded
    > Update Boarding Groups:
    > Allow us to create a boarding group for Cog Buildings, Field Offices, etc.
    > Remove the Go Button so people have to walk to the Elevator
    > Allow us to teleport to the Elevator of Factories and Cog Bosses
    > Update Racing:
    > Make karts work like TTR
    > When you do a practice race, it should be against AI.
    > There should be boxes to get there too.
    > Drift should work like Mario Kart
    > ALL tracks should be ravamped to work with the new physics.
    > Make all existing karts cost 100 Tickets at start but return to their normal price afterward.
    > Make all karts have special controls like in Mario Kart.
    > Add new Karts with unique controls.
    > Let people know the Unique Controls of each kart prior and after purchases.
    > Add my own Election Event
    > It's story based like Toontown Rewritten but the fighting acts like Toontown Infinite.
    > The election should be Flippy vs Dippy vs Kitty vs Blippy (a reference to the Landmark Buildings Design Documents)
    > Instead of a One-Time event, this should be playable at the start of the game
    > The Toons should not win and Dippy, Kitty, Blippy should get captured while Flippy and your Toon escapes thus making him the defacto mayor to stay true to the lore.
    > Any experience you gain from the battle should stay
    > Make the Elevator close after 5 seconds when 4 to 8 Toons are on the Elevator.
    > In Bosses, if there are 4 Toons, there should be 1 battle going on.
    > Like in Wizard101, for a set period of time, add the ability to return to a dungeon if you die.
    > Remove the ability to leave during the in-between rounds of the Boss battles.
    > When a Cog Building falls, instead of squishing the trees, it should make the tree's leaves fall off because of the nearby smog.
    > Make trap damage meet between TTR and Clash's trap damage!
    > Make TNT kill 12s
    > Make Railroad kill 13s
    > Make ALL Clocks (Even Cog building ones) in Toontown reflect Toontown Time aka PST since Toontown takes place in Calisota!
    > Remove Clothing Ticket Toontasks
    > Make all clothing purchasable via Jellybeans
    > Make all shaders match that which it is reflecting aka a Toon's shadow should be of itself, not a circle regardless what shaders you're using.
    > When we implement shaders, we should add CRT and VHS tape filters
    > Make the clouds be at various levels through out the day.
    > If you wait in front of Cogs anywhere, have the Cogs taunt the Toons
    > If you want to train your Doodle, you should have one option:
        > Play a doodle minigame like in Wizard101
            > Each Minigame should be tailored to a certain trick.
    > Since we only need one District, I should remove the Districts page
    > Add special event areas that only become available when 
    > Rewrite the Toontown Online Story so it doesn't interfere with the DuckTales Storyline but instead goes with it.
    > Sync the clocks back 20 years and have each day go by 48 hours at a time.
