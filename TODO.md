An Estate Update which does a complete overhaul to the current estate by...:

    + Adding new houses for new Toons
    + Add clickable NPC nametags to view information about that specific Toon
    + A couple of streets that could lead to areas such as a Doodle park, a store where you can buy fertilizer and other items
    + The fisherman or fisherwoman in your estate has his/her own home inside the estate.
    + On top of having a fisherman/fisherwoman in your estate, your Doodle could eat the fish for you for higher affection levels and less hunger levels (could perhaps be added in a Doodle Update)
    + Stone plots to plant stone statues in front of your house instead of flowers.
    + More plots to have a larger garden and more organic gags to make the game easier for both maxing watering can and for completing the game
    + Add more Estate Exterior Types.
    + On/off light switches or candles for each room (depending on the house type.)
    + A working tv that can be turned on/off and the volume can be adjusted and this comes with custom made animations just for this game but can also have already loaded in mp4 files.
    + A jukebox outside of the estate that loads Toontown Music and can load MP3s 
    + A street that connects the estates to the rest of Toontown (like in the Funny Farm area (if we add that)) but if you and your friend enter the street leading to the estates, your friend will comes out of the tunnel in his/her own estate but not the same area as your Toon unless you teleport to your friend.
    + Add picnic tables
    + Add the ability to sleep in your bed and once your Toon wakes up, (s)he gains a specific boost of their choosing once they wake up and (s)he has slept for a specific amount of time.
    + Add a working jetpack from the catalog that lets you fly in the air for a specific amount of time
    + add a multi-kart garage for each your karts
    + add a sprinkler system that you can turn on and your plants will automatically be watered for you but might or might not receive XP for it (that would have to be discussed)
    + Edible Food that gives you boosts when you eat them.
    + Sitting on the chair or the couch in your estate or around Toontown for a set amount of time can give you a speed boost for a limited amount of time.
    + Two people can sit on the regular couch
    + only one person can sit on the chair at a time
    + one person can lay or sit on the bed at a time
    + Flint and Steel can be bought from the catalog to light up a campfire outside, to light the candles, and to light the fireplace in your house and the flame will wither out and die after a while
    + Estate Upgrades for if you want to add more stories to a house and what not instead of buying a new house.
    + Estate Upgrades take time to add onto the house, the bigger they are, the longer it takes
    + Lit candles gives off its own light, just like the fireplace and the campfire
    + Whenever you sleep or sit down, it should auto-activate a more restricted version of the oobe command (which means you can move your camera around but only above and around your Toon but it cannot move beneath the bed, beneath the floor, through the ceiling, through the wall, etc.) so it’s not at an * uncomfortable*  angle whenever your Toon sleeps.
    + Add shops that you can buy objects, furnature, and more from to build your house around Toontown
    + Items like Flags can be hung in the corner of the house that touch the two corners of your Toon’s house
    + You can move items outside like in ODS
    + Bungalow Houses with interiors that look like Bungalow Houses but are bigger on the inside...
    + Tiki Houses with interiors that look like Tikis but are larger on the inside
    + XP for Watering and Shoveling should match what level your watering can or shovel is at.
    + During the winter, give the option to shovel the path around your house for x amount of Shoveling XP (x = current level of shovel)
    More to be added...
    + Allow us to see outside of our window in Estate
    + Fences or walls around the back of the houses (so like the castle has brick walled-fence, the cabin has a wooden fence, etc.),
    + A new house as a default house like what Disney was going to do before they added the current default house model as a placeholder
    + Allow pets to come into our Estate when you're not home.
    + Add  the ability to move houses to a different color.
    + More items for the catalog thus more pages for the catalog.
    + Fireplaces should be built into each house and not separate
    + Whenever you buy a new house, it takes anywhere from a day to a week to completely build the new house since you are replacing your previous house
    ~ Make the estates useful in the game and give them the original scrapped sound track found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_k_F49rYCo/ (slowed down a bit) and here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bTSXCdmLkw/
    - AFK gets turned off whenever your Toon is in bed because your Toon is already sleeping.
    - Whenever your Toon goes to sleep, your Toon teleports to his/her estate and goes into the house and hops onto the bed and sleeps but you won’t be logged out of your Toon anymore and whenever you’re ready to come back to your Toon, all you have to do is click or tap the exit button on your screen and you’re ready to get back in action but you can still exit to Pick-A-Toon screen using your Schticker Book.
    - remove the feature that you have to plant a Silver Jellybean to plant a statue that you already paid for
    - three people can sit on the hay couch or one person can lay on it.
    - fix the target game in the estate so it acts like its counterpart the cannon game in parties but it still Toons you up for every time you hit the target (the target also acts like the clouds except it heals you whenever you hit it.)

Make The Friendly Update which overhauls the Friendship system by reworking things in the source code. These changes would include:

    + Add a Near-By Toons menu to the list of Menus in your Friends menu.
    + Optimize the code as much as we can to make as many Friends as we can
    + Add the ability to search and filter between your friends
    ~ Updating the artwork of the Friends Button

    ~ Updating the Profile GUI of the Toon you click on.
    ~ Increasing the maximum number of friends you can have without lagging the game client.
    ~ Making the Friends button smaller for more screens to further enhance the already immersed game.
    ~ And more!

Adding The Expression Update to make the following changes to the game...:

    + A Basic & an Advanced Toon Creation sections.
    + Advanced Basic Toon Personalities
    + Advanced Body Height
    + Advanced Body Width
    + Right before your Toon falls asleep, your Toon should yawn, like on Toontown: Corporate Clash, but for Open-Fantasy, your Toon puts their hands behind their head in a stretch, the front of the feet lift up like they're reaching, their eyes should slowly close before they fall asleep.
    + Different Eye Colors (In one or both eyes)
    + Wear, apply, change, and/or remove makeup.

    + A more diverse, unique, and advanced option/variety of clothes, accessories, etc. including long and short dresses, jumpsuits, capris, more realistic shorts, different types of shorts, pants, crop-top shirts, various lengths of shorts, and more!
    + Some accessories and clothing will give you boosts in specific areas and will not just be for the looks like Toontown Relived did.
    + New Animations to the game like the T-Pose Animation and more (I couldn’t think of more animations off of the top of my head.)
    + Achievements
    + Daily Challenges 
    + Tons of rewards for completing achievements or challenges...
    + Colored Gloves with each color matching each of the Toon’s colors and the ability to revert it back to white colored Gloves.
    + The ability to switch your gloves in your Accessories Trunk to the Glove colors you have already bought.
    + The ability to equip Cheesy Effects in your shticker book that you have unlocked through Toontasks.
        > Make Cheesy Effect Toontasks Permanent

    + Add species pros and cons for a more strategic create-a-toon process
    + Make it so the floor sound effects are dynamic and change depending on what your Toon steps on.

    + Reimplement the Taunt Emotion/Animation
    ~ Bean Body Ducks

Adding The Stadium Update changes the game in the following ways...:

    + Adds Toon Island Stadium as a massive playground split into various areas through tunnels that leads to the specific area you want to go to.
    + All mini-games (Racing, Golfing, regular table games, even the Trolley, and the Party Station get their own areas, plus and new games such as volleyball, dodgeball, TvT (which is Toon versus Toon), Reversed Battle Royale, Toon Tag, etc....) are readded into the game from TTO with the original content and new content added back.
    + Each Mini-game has its own designated area that’s colored in its own set of colors.
    + In the Racing Area, there are two sections: the usual layouts for races on the sides plus more and another area for Street Racing.
    + Street Racing is exactly that what it sounds like... It’s street racing but it’s around a custom made street that’s designed after one of the original playgrounds in TTO.
    + In the center of the designated area for racing, there is a Kart Shop where you can buy a Kart, color, and accessories for the Kart
    + When you do a practice race, it should be against AI.
    + There should be Item Boxes in Practice Mode.
    + Drift should work like Mario Kart
    + Remove collision slowdown when driving your kart into the walls of the racetrack unless you're hitting it dead on.
    + Specific Accessories (i.e. a Muffler, a spoiler, etc.) would give your Toon perks in an actual Race however these buffs aren’t by much so it’s not that unfair.
    + Doodle Racing where you race Doodles with other Toons or with an AI or multiple AI.
    + You’d be able to take out your Kart at any time in the game to get to places faster.
    + In the Golfing Area, there is another split one that gives you Mini-Golf and the other gives you actual Golf.
    + In the center of the two areas, there is a shop where you would buy golf clubs with different perks and different colored Golf Balls.
    + In the center of the main area in the playground, there is a pillar with a staircase leading up to a windowed viewing area where if you walk up to the binoculars aimed at each specific area for each mini-game, you can view someone doing that mini-game. If there are multiple people doing the same mini-game, a menu would pop up asking who would like to view race or golf or play a game and once you pick, you automatically view it as a spectator.
    + There is also a mini gift shop in the Viewing Tower tucked away in a corner where a Toon is behind the counter in a small room and there you can buy clothing items you normally wouldn’t be able to get anywhere else and the items would rotate every week or so. (If it runs out of things to sell, it will cycle back to the first one that it has and the new one won’t be shown until it cycles to the newest issue.)
    + Each Trophy you win in each mini-game, you can display at your estate within a Trophy Case which can be bought from the catalog.
    + TvT would have its own area where you would try to Green the other Toon or Toons and try to be the last one standing.
    + A Reversed Battle Royale is where your Toon and 7 to 14 others start out at 1 Laff and must heal themselves to a randomized Laff between 70 and whatever the max Laff is. You can find loot boxes that either give you a randomized amount of Laff, can cause you to lose Laff, automatically be disqualified from the match, give you an item that causes anywhere from one to the seven other Toons to lose a specific amount of Laff. Meanwhile, random heals are popping up all over the map. Oh, and the map randomizes each time you play.
    + Player Titles that can be displayed on the MiniGames Page in your Shticker Book and it will show up underneath your Toon’s name within the name tag for other Toons to see (it’s kind of like what ODS has for equipping achievements.)
    + Another part would be a recreation of the original Toon Tag from back in Disney’s Virtual Reality set found before TTO began production but instead of playing as Disney Characters, you play as your own Toon.
    + Boarding Groups for each activity can be made.
        > Allow us to create a boarding group for Cog Buildings, Field Offices, Estate Visits, etc.
        > Remove the Go Button so people have to walk to the Elevator
        > Allow us to teleport to the Elevator of Factories and Cog Bosses
    + If there are not enough players who will play with you on a specific mini-game, you will still be able to go in but instead of another person going up against you, it’s an AI who is sent in as a stand in for the other players portrayed as a regular Toon. (it would be an easy enough win if you are playing correctly) This way you can still receive trophies and extra Laff points for racing or golfing or whatever even if you don’t have anybody else, thus diminishing the need for an alternative account to play by yourself.
    + Each Mini-game could have its own leveling system or else it’s just one big leveling system.
    + The trolley games and other mini-games that have an AI Toon should become more difficult depending on how well you are doing in said mini-game or trolley game and it would be the next game or mini-game’s difficulty off of that.
    + Crane Game Trolley Game where you have to use a crane to pick up a Cog and drop them onto each other or into lava to protect Laff Barrels that way we can practice using the Crane before we get to the CFO.
    + Add a Fashion Show game that you participate in to show off your clothing and get judged for it while you go head-to-head against other Toons or AI who are trying to win.
    + Add Skip button to the Trolley mini-games
    + Add a Battle Royalet trolley game located in Toontown Stadium where you try to run around the map to heal your teammates (who spawn randomly around the map) and green the other team before the other team heals their team member OR before time runs out (Your Laff is changed to a pre-set amount when the match begins and is reset back to the user's original laff after the match is over)
        > You fight against AI in singleplayer mode.
    > Add a Capture the Flag Trolley Game where you have to use your sound to stun the enemy team while you try to capture the enemy team's flag before time runs out OR before the other team gets your flag!
    + Red Light, Green Light Trolley Game
    + Squid Game Trolley Game
    + Reimplement Photo Fun if it isn't already implemented.
    ~ Blizzard Boulevard would get its own area in the Racing Section since it could easily become its own race track.
    ~ Fixing Racing
    ~ Fixing Golfing

Add an update titled The Purchasing Update that overhauls multiple sections of the game including but not limited to Clothing, Money, The Catalog, and more by adding the following changes:

    + Adding multiple forms of purchasing capabilities near the end of the main story like using Jelly Card, a lighter and simpler way to hold your Jellybeans
    + Add the bank building model from TTI and be able to open an account to use a Jelly Card and you can just pull jellybeans from the bank into your Jar.

    + Add Dresses and Jumpsuits to the game.
    + Have the individual plain colored clothes buyable from the catalog or the Clothing Store.
    + Make the Clothing Store look like an actual Clothing Store with racks of different clothes and a round table with skirts, a higher-up rack for dresses, shelves for shirts that are folded, with the Tailor behind a desk to fit the clothes just for you for enough Jellybeans, and a curtain with a room behind it so that you can try on clothes you want and when you’re done, you either buy it or put it back.
    + Add Customizable Clothing Items where you can customize your own clothes and sleeves with a color palette, textures from the phase files, decals you collect from around Toon Island and maybe around Toontown and maybe even upload your own textures and decals for your own Toon’s eyes to see but not to everybody else’s (since they will see randomized clothing items on your body since they would be uploaded locally and not on the cloud or wherever the server is located.)
    + Clothing and accessory Items that represent Pride that comes out during Pride Month and stays during Pride Month and doesn’t come back until the beginning of the same month, the next year.
    + Add the ability to sell a clothing item or accessory to earn Jellybeans
    + Make Clothing Shops sell clothes and accessories that match the playground that they are situated in.
    + A clothing line that comes out during Pride Month for all of those Toons with Pride including but not limited to dresses, skirts, shorts, shirts, shoes, bows, bowties, backpacks, socks, glasses, and whatnot.

    + A way to give unwanted clothes to other toons like we could say we can give the shirt, pants/skirt, dress/jumpsuit to a friend or to a random person in the game that wants it.
    + Maybe by having an in-game Wishlist for specific items that you want and somebody could gift it to you if they want to by either buying it or giving their own clothes to that person or persons. -- Dontai and Gracie

    + Each playground's Clothing Store should have clothes based on each Playground's themes.
    + Add dresses for the females and jumpsuits for the males and merge some of the textures like the sound shirt and pants and the plain shirt and skirt into one to lessen the amount of shirts/skirts/pants that are separate while adding new content and making the textures that look like one piece actually be one piece.

    ~ the Plain colored clothes from Create-A-Toon screen and make them into same color dresses.
    ~ Make all clothing purchasable via Jellybeans

    + A Button that is labeled “Dominate Hand” that, when tapped/clicked, opens a drop down menu that has four buttons that say: “Back”, “Left Hand”, “Right Hand”, & “Both Hands” that allows you to exit the drop down menu, use your left hand, your right hand, or both hands or use a slider that does the same thing.

    + Redesigning of Gags
    + When you choose a Toon-Up Gag in battle and no other Toons are there, a random NPC should be called into battle to do the Toon-Up on you.
    + We should do a contest for the addition of more Megaphone Jokes.
    + If a Megaphone Joke misses, the Cogs should laugh and the other Toons should half-heartedly laugh.
    + Make Squirt be a Damage Over Time Gag with Soak
        > That soak slowly kills their electronics over a short period of time by short ciruiting them
        > That period of time can expire
        > When a cog is electricuted, they take damage and their attacks have a massive chance to miss.
    + Make certain Cog attacks do Damage Over Time like Fired and such
    + Each Toon has the chance to attack a Cog naturally through Instinctual Attacks like, for example a Cat can scratch an enemy either dealing damage or making the enemy weaker, depending on the type of enemy or a horse can punch or kick an enemy, dealing damage. (This attack would be completely randomized during battle and could not be chosen as an attack by the player.)
    + Add the ability to make Clans and Groups
    + Hold 6+ ToonTasks later in the game.
    + What if when a Toon goes sad, he/she can still stay in battle at the cost of their Gags only dealing 80% of their base damage? And after a single battle is cleared, all sad Toons receive an up to 20+ Laff boost.
    + We could also have a mechanic where ALL of them have to go sad for them to be kicked back to the playground. For example, if there are 3 Toons battling a Cog, he has to keep attacking them until all 3 Toons have no Laff points left. And in addition you can stay in battle and Toon-Up still works if people use it on you
    + Make Knock Knock Door Jokes heal your Toon
        > The more smog there is, the less the door heals your Toon.
    + The higher level playground you're in, the more you should auto-heal.

    ~ Make TNT kill 12s
    ~ Make Railroad kill 13s
    - Remove the ability to leave during the in-between rounds of the Boss battles.
    - Remove experience cap

The Construction Update:

    + Use a new version of the concept for Construction Zone for this game’s Island because content...
    + You’d have to swing around on ropes and do parkour to get around in the playground and occasionally the streets to have new ways to play and the Cogs on the street would have to fly over gaps that fall into a river. 
    Whenever you’d fall down, you’d get teleported back up to the last platform because of an explanation that could be given: A safety mechanism that causes a black hole to open beneath you and teleport you back up to the last platform.
    + In the playground, there would be a crane where you could climb up and then move the crane which has a rope in the crane and you’d be able to direct the crane to which platform you would need. 
    + There would also be NPC workers working around the playground. There would be two gag shop clerks outside because the gag shop is not built yet. 
    + There would be a piping area where your Toon could enter through a hole in the ground where you can find a massive + Red Mole and regular mole problem that could be the center of a main story task or a side story task.

A Weather Update that changes the game in the following ways...:

    + Adds rain
    + Adds snow
    + Add hail
    + Add lightning
    + Add our own version of the Storm of the Century storyline but in multiple playgrounds/areas and following that could be our own version of Operation: Storm Sellbot with power outages and what not.

    + A different music for during the storms
    + Add districts that are safe from the Storms for those with PCs/devices that cannot handle the weather.
    + Add Default Districts where, by default, you spawn in that district, like what ODS has to prevent losing people who cannot spawn in the weather without lagging
    + If your Toon touches a Tornado or a Hurricane, you get hurt and you can go Sad but if you do go Sad, your Toon doesn’t lose his/her Gags by doing so.
    + Combined weather (like Rain and Hail)
    + Add an NPC Seer any Toon can visit that tells your Toon the Weather or add items to the Catalog that can predict the weather or add phones to the game that can tell you the weather...

The Catalog Update makes the Catalog Relevant again by doing the following to the game...:

    + Adds different Catalog Types where you can buy specific items from that category within the catalog
    + You can change between the Catalog Types using a button on the screen
    + You can buy access to different types of catalogs and your Toon receives that new Catalog type the very next day and your Toon would get the next version of the Catalog on that same day, the next week.
    + Add a Clothing Category where you would buy Clothing for a randomized price however if it is on the catalog and in the Clothing Shop, it would not always be cheaper than buying it from the Clothing Shop.
    + Toon Rewrite
        > Adds the ability to rewrite anything about yourself, including your name.
        > Has a cooldown of 2 months or something like that.

            > Design Wise, I think we should avoid the TTUU's CZ and go for the original look.
            > The overall look should be unfinished. So, the NPCs for the Toon HQ, Gag Shop, etc. should be outside (Gag shop should have a pile of random gags behind the clerks.
            > Parkour should be the main way to get around most of the playground and its streets to get to.

            > The Quests should be to help build the playground.
        > Funny Farms:
            > Instead of the street design, you could make Funny Farm open and have the task line revolve around one family and their farming needs including getting rid of Cogs, pulling wheat and corn and what not, etc.
            > There are multiple farms and you are required to help so Toons can be fed.
            > Each Toontask should be helping them in different ways.
            > The playground should be a short one but not too short.
            > We should take inspiration from Bear E. Funny's Funny Farm but keep it different.

            > You fight against AI in singleplayer mode.
            > Add a Capture the Flag Mini Game around the playground where you have to use your sound to stun the enemy team while you try to capture the enemy team's flag before time runs out OR before the other team gets your flag!
            > Around the edges of the Stadium, put the Race Track Pads and the Golf Carts > Tunnels to indicate where the activities will be held.
            > Activating a Mini-Game is like how you do it in a Party.
            > Add sand pits where you can play Volley Ball with AIs.
            > In the middle of the playground, there should be a beanstalk coming through the middle of the Shop with vines you can jump onto and do 3D Jungle Vines to get to the top.
            > The top of the beanstalk should be a cloud you can walk on.  This is technically a new area called Flippy's Skyclan for later usage.

            > Around the playground, add cannons to bounce off of the low-hanging clouds.
                > When you land on the ground, you shouldn't be interrupted by a pop-up GUI, instead we should replace it with the Jellybean Jar Icon and a counter counting the amount of Jellybeans Earned > How much experience you've gained.
            > When you're doing an activity, wind should affect you.
        > The Cog Headquarters:
            > To expand upon the idea that the Cog Headquarters were once Toon Playgrounds, there should be Cogified Toon Buildings around the Headquarters.

The Magical Update: Part 2:

    + Adds a second part to the side taskline
    + And More



Live Download Updates:
    + Announce when there's a new update to download
    + Make it so you don't need to relog to gather the new update.
    + This would use a downloader, restricting areas in-game that need to be updated.
    + If you're in an area that need to be updated, you can stay in it and it'll be refreshed when it's downloaded

The Infinity Tower:

    + The Infinity Tower is a 20 story Cog Building that uses experimental Quantum Technology to loop the Toon/Cog through an infinite number of 20 story tall Cog Buildings an infinite number of universes.
    ~ Remake all models and replace 2d models with 3d models and have the mouths move up and down to the sound effects or to the sound of the voice actor, and do that to Toons as well, redraw all 2D textures and make them HD and maybe even in 4K and have the ability to lower and raise the quality depending on the computer type you have and what you can handle, also redo all of the music and sound effects in order to make the game feel newer/fresher.
    + Featured Toontown meme of the month featured in the launcher.
    ~ A complete overhaul to the map and the map page so that the tunnels are in the correct place and so you can zoom in and zoom out of the map and click-to-drag the map so that we don't have to make more maps, it's just 1 large map that shows both the streets and the playground in great detail and can show where you and your friends are on the map, where your Toontask is located while patching the bug where you can teleport to the Minigolf area since it isn't classified as a playground because it isn't on the map, and whatnot.
    + You can open your map anywhere by pressing the 'm' key or by pressing alt on your keyboard and the map shows everywhere so that you don't have to open your Shtiker Book every time you want to view the map.
    + Add the ability to actually friend a Cog but it works like 0.01% of the time and when it does, your friend Cog can help you in battle but it can only happen as long as a another Cog doesn't see you otherwise, the Cog is killed by its fellow comrades because the Chairman ordered it.
    + Bring back Partners and add a feature on the launcher and the website where we can feature stories, videos, YouTube and Twitch channels, and possibly even other games in case the others don't like our game or are done with the game and want something else to do until the next piece of story/content is out in the game.
    + Goose Species with an actual goose hjonking sound effect.
    + Sprocket Coins
    + You get sprocket coins from defeating cogs, the harder the cogs the more sprocket coins you get, this will be one of the main motives for the Infinite Tower as you’ll get more and more as you go along. This will create the effect as you go along less grind and more hard

You can then spend these coins on buffs, some ideas:

    + X movement speed Y time
    + X gag exp Y time
    + X gag accuracy Y time
    + X cog damage Y time
    + X cog accuracy Y time
    + X jump boost Y time

Other buff ideas:

    + X Gag damage for Y time
    + X Cog defense for Y time
    + X temporary Laff boost for Y time

Sprocket Coin Drop Rates:

    + Bronze =  20 +  (hood difficulty x 5) ; in TTC, the rate would be 25%
    + Silver = 10 +  (hood difficulty x 1.5) ; in MML, the rate would be 16%
    + Gold = 5 +  (hood difficulty x 0.25) : in DDL, the rate would be 6.5%
    + The amount for each sprocket is randomly chosen from (Cog level x 1) to (Cog level x 1.35 rounded down)
    + For example, a level 12 Cog would drop 12~16 of each sprocket.

Starting from MML, the rarer sprocket coins will start to appear more often than the more common ones.
For example:

    + Bronze = 40 - (difficulty x 2.5) ; in an area with a difficulty of 8, the chance is 20%
    + Silver = 16 - (difficulty x 0.75) ; in an area with a difficulty of 8, the chance is 10%
    + Gold = 6 +  (difficulty x 1.5) ; in an area with a difficulty of 16, the chance is 30%
    + And you can either redeem them from your Shtiker Book or you can go all of the way to the Witch of the Mountain to redeem it there.
    + Have your Toon actually have the option to react and reply to the Toon/NPC they're talking to but have multiple options and have the dialog affect what the NPC says to make it feel even more like an MMORPG but add this feature like before the game releases to the public.
    And then slide some Easter eggs in there...
    A possible Easter Egg could happen whenever you're approaching Flippy for the first time outside of the Toontorial and this would utilize Multiverse Theory which is a real thing in the game because the Districts are separate universes, so maybe we could reference other Toontown games or Disney properties without directly mentioning them. -- Gracie & Scott/Froge/Anne
    + toon profiles that show toon id, gags, doodle, current tasks, laff, maybe even preferred pronouns? -- Scott/Froge/Anne
    + Challenge page in your book that has the daily and weekly tasks as well as permanent challenges that you can do as you progress through the game. Possibly giving you accessories, name tags, doodle accessories? Possibly even special houses? (Rewards are based on difficulty of the challenge, giving players something to work for besides laff and suits) -- Boomer
    + Toon Breasts to female Toons to be more accurate to the real world and to DuckTales
        > This would have a slider.
    + Custom doodle stats (Which could cost more beans or something) could possibly only customize stats in the higher playgrounds
    + Use the leaked concepts from TTO’s beginning in our game -- Gracie
    + When you buy a doodle have the option to customize it like what you want. Be able to pick the ears eyes nose tail color pattern stripes. -- Tegan
    + Make fishing's rng less terrible. Since this isn't a subscription-based game like tto, we really shouldn't need to waste weeks, even months on rolling the dice and hoping we get those new species we need. Perhaps we could make fishing less rare, or come up with a whole new idea? -- Scott/Froge/Anne
    + Make our own Racoon Toons --Scott/Froge/Anne
    + Crab Toons -- Gracie
    + Skunk Toons -- Scott/Froge/Anne
    + When signing up to become a Resistance Ranger in Twilight Dreamland, on top of getting a salute, you also get custom Resistance Ranger clothes and accessories in the mail but instead of having you sign up, have it be a part of the taskline where you’re recruited for the Resistance? The stuff is sent in the mail and you go on to fight bigger cogs for later on in the taskline.
    + Talking animations.

Toon Tags Update:

    + Toon Tags so others know you’re the real deal or if you’re a fake -- Gracie
    + The ability to click on your own name tag to see your own Toon, Toon stats, gags, toontasks, and probably your own Toon Tag so you don’t have to rely on using another Toon to see it and tell you it. -- Gracie
    + Customizable Toon IDs but don’t allow people to create a Toontag that’s already taken by someone else. Like a first come first serve basis. -- Hunter Boppen & Gracie
    + Shows who’s staff in the game. Could be a title below the name or a symbol above the name; or a symbol once you click the name tag. -- Revolution
    + Add the ability for the staff and streamers to hide their title or icon on other Toons so that you don’t attract any unwanted attention -- Gracie
    + Interactive furniture such as a playable piano -- Sir Fangar and Gracie
    + Cogs that turn their head and look at your Toon when they walk by like what’s in Toontown Frenchy
    + Mounts like hoverboards (Flame) or any mounts to get to places faster, even if it is as weak as driving your car down the street. -- Gracie
    + A museum for cogs with stats on how many of said cogs are defeated and also it should have Dinosaur Toon bones and extinct types of Toons as well as a Cog Display to really give it a museum vibe and on top of that, there are little documents that you can walk up to and press "read" to get some lore about that type of species and the museum should also have Top Toons in there and it should be playing the scrapped Museum theme ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIZf0zexKSQ ) as the interior music.
    + Dropped items that you find for defeating Cogs that you can sell to the Museum for Jellybeans that you can also view in your Shtiker Book how many items you have and of what kind.

The Pets Update:

    + Add Puffles
    + Type-A-Name for Doodles
    + Add a ton of new Pet Tricks
        > To train each trick up, you should be able to either spam-click it OR play a minigame (which is more effective) should be tailored to a certain trick.
    + The more you train a doodle, the better it should be.
    + Add the ability to allow your Toon to travel with your Pet

The Toon Tips Update:

    ~ Replace the Toon Tips from the loading screen with Toon Tips that appear to the side of the screen that you can also view in your Shtiker Book!
    - Remove ALL loading screens except for the loading screen for entering the game.

Silly Meter Update:

    + Do a Silly Meter Update but do it better than TTR.
    + Make Street Props always stay animated.
    + Add Street Props to all of the Playgrounds
    + Instead of Silly Meter Teams, the followering should happen ALL at once BUT it should ONLY happen after meeting a certain quota (Sillier times like Holidays make this easier to complete.):
        > Gardening Speed is Boosted
        > Global Toontown Teleportation
        > Double Racing Tickets

        > Boosted Toon Attack Accuracy
        > Higher Chance of Dodging attacks
        > Toon's Walking, Sprinting, and Animation Speeds are all slightly boosted.
    + The Silly Meter should have an adaptable Build Up depending on who is online to make it easier or harder to adapt to the people online.
    + There should be a side quest to fix it and it should stay fixed that way it's like a late game award

The Globalization Update:

    + Add support for multiple languages that were included in TTO. Including English, Spanish, German, Portugese, Japanese, French, Latin, and more!
    + Add an AI System that allows text from another language to be translated to the language of Toontown that your Toon is playing on thus allowing people from all around the world to play Toontown without the language barriers that block the Toontown community as of right now…
    
Model Overhaul Update:

    ~ Remake the Treasure Icons in 3D like what Corporate Clash did.
    ~ Remodel the Street Lamps
    + Add benches around Toontown's Playgrounds, Streets, and the Estate to make Toontown look more lived-in
    ~ Remake the Street Signs
        > Redraw the Street Sign Textures without the Classic Character's Heads.
        > Make the Pointers 3D
    ~ Remake the Fences to be 3D

Staff Update:

    + For Moderators, there should be a page in your Shtiker Book that appears for the Spellbook
    + Create a tool to make it easy to add Quests to playgrounds like what Toontown Infinite had created for it by Joshsora.
        > This tool should also allow for us to add Animations and Emotes to match Dialog.

    + Allow us to see the sky in the Factory Roof

    + Add Trolling to the list of reportable options.
    + Like in Wizard101, for a set period of time, add the ability to return to a dungeon if you die.

    + Add stairs to tunnels
    + Add Hot Tubs
    + Make the instruments in The Land of Music playable when you step on them.
    + Re-rig the Toon HQ doors in Twilight Dreamland to better work with their models.
    + Add Twondo, the game Dos but Toonified.
    + Add Cog Streets
    + The Short Change should have a short body like on Toontown: Corporate Clash
    + The Micromanager should be Microsized like on Toontown: Corporate Clash
    + Make any crash in the game not close the game.
    + If you wait in front of Cogs anywhere, have the Cogs taunt the Toons
    + Client Sided Jukebox's around the playgrounds
    + Add throwable snowballs you get can from Tundra Wonderland
    ~ Move the spawn area of the HQ to a safe place instead of in the Cog's way.

            > You should start with a Cog round, then go onto a Mini-Game that's randomly chosen unless you have a Toontask for a specific Mini-Game, then onto another Cog Round, then onto the Boss round.
            > Like in TTR, you should start with limited Gags.
                > For each Mini-Game, you collect Jokes to get back at least 2 Gag Tracks per floor and Laff.

        > A Chief Justice Boss Battle Update:
            > This update gives you multiple rewards per Boss Run

    > Cog Attacks should have the ability to do Damage Over Time.
    > You should be able to pick your Boss Rewards with your Gags. The only time you forfeit your ability to pick a gag is when you use a Pets.

    > Remove the Friends List
    > A Battle Overhaul:

        > Adds a new area called Mount Acorn you can access through the Abandoned Tunnel in Acorn Acres
    > During the late game, there should be Overclocked Bosses
        > The reason you've never heard of the Overclocked Boss in-universe is that, after you defeat a Sellbot Field Office, you collect a note that begins talking about Project: Overclock but it doesn't reveal to much. So, you must do more of the Sellbot Field Offices to retrieve more of the notes.
        > When you first go into the Overclocked Vice President, he instantly tells that you're a Toon and makes you go sad instantly. This has a one-time benefit though that you collect a piece of paper that tells of a Magical Witch on the outskirts of Acorn Acres

        > Add the ability to toggle through shaders in the Shtiker Book as well as outside the game
        > Redraw the Suit Parts.
