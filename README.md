# What is Toontown Fantasy?
 
> Introducing PLAYER ZER0 STUDIO's Toontown Fantasy, a new kind of Toontown game made by the community, for the community! Our goal is to bring you a brand new genre of Toontown game with heavy focus on storytelling and world building through exploration! As with the rest of Toontown, our game will be set within the Tooniverse but we will be taking light inspiration from the reworked `Twinkling Shadows - A Toontown Story` (and it's successor `Twinkling Shadows II: The Wrath of Chadwyk`) while keeping it faithful to a DuckTales (2017) timeline variant! The fate of the universe is hanging in the balance, so make your Toon then set out on a trilling adventure to save your world from the clutches of The Chairman, the rest of C.O.G. Incorporated, and beyond!
