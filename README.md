### Setup - Windows:

> After cloning the repository, you will need to clone the resources repository inside the directory where you cloned the source repo.
>
> Secondly, you would have to clone, compile, and install a specific version of [Panda3D][PandaLink] to run this source code!
>
> Third, once you've finished that, install [Pip][PipLink] then open CMD and move to the Toontown Fantasy directory before using `Pip install -r requirements.txt` (Sometimes, you need to add the Panda3D/Python/Scripts directory prior to the `Pip` command for it to work!)
>
> Next, go into the `win32/` folder and right click on `start_all.bat` then click `Create shortcut` (on Windows 11, after right clicking `start_all.bat`, you have to press `Show more options` for Create Shortcut to work!)
>
> Once you've created a shortcut, highlight the shortcut and move it where ever you wish to launch the game from.
