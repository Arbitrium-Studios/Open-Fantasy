How to Upgrade the Dev Servers for toon.dc (and other) changes
--------------------------------------------------------------

Hopefully, if you find you need to make changes to toon.dc, or to
avatar DNA, etc. you will have tested it on your own personal copies
of the servers, and not messed with the "dev" servers, which are meant
to be kept in sync with what has been committed to CVS.

Having done this, when you are ready to commit your code, you should do
the following, so as not to trip up people who use the dev servers.

1) Test the code you have changed with your private servers.

2) If the list of dna files has changed, update the list in
   toontown.par

3) Check the client code into CVS

4) a) ftp to 206.18.93.17 (the "dev" server box)
   b) login as user: toon, password: town
   c) copy your toon.dc file to /usr/home/toon/

5) a) Shout to everyone that the "dev" server is going down
   b) telnet to 206.18.93.17
   c) edit clientagent.par to increment the CLIENT_VERSION_CHECK
   d) Do the following to kill the servers:
      killall toon_aiserver
      killall toon_dbserver
      killall toon_stateserver
      killall toon_messagedire
      killall toon_clientagent
   e) If you feel you need to wipe out the database (Toon DNA has changed,
      or a new Toon field has been added), then do:
      rm toontown.dat
   f) restart the killed processes (no need for "&"... they auto-background)
      ./toon_aiserver
      ./toon_dbserver
      ./toon_stateserver
      ./toon_messagedirector
      ./toon_clientagent

6) Test your checked in code against the "dev" server.

7) Shout to everyone that the dev server is back up.
