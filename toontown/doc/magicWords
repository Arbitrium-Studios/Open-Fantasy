    The <track> is normally the name of the track, e.g. "throw",
    "drop", or "toon-up", or "all" to indicate all accessible
    tracks.  The <increment> may be negative.  If <increment> is
    omitted, the amount necessary to reach the next level is
    added.

    or if the score is omitted, restores it to its correct value.

~nochat : Removes special chat permissions.

~rename <newname>
    renames your avatar.  With ~for, renames some other avatar.  This
    word is disabled by default; it may be enabled by an AI Configrc var.

~badname : renames your avatar to "toon999", where 999 is from your doId.
~badname <avatar> : renames the indicated avatar as above, used like ~for.

~effect <effectName> [<timeLimit>]
    Applies a cheesy rendering effect to your toon.  The effects are
    named in ToontownGlobals.CE* (omit the CE part of the name here).
    If timeLimit is specified, it indicates the length of time for
    which the effect should persist, in minutes.

~cogTakeOver [x|<track>] [x|<level>] [all|this|<block>] [all|<zone>] [now] [slow]
    : cog take over building.
    <track> is a cog track, one of c, s, m, l; or x to pick at random.
    <level> is the level of the cog: 1..9, or x to pick at random based on
      the neighborhood.
    <block> is a building block number (defaults to "this", the door you're
      standing in front of) or "all"  e.g. 1
    <zone> is the branch ID (defaults to your current zone)  e.g. 2200

    If the keyword "now" is included, the building is taken over
    immediately without a cog's intervention; otherwise, the normal
    behavior is to drop a cog onto the street right in front of the
    building to do the job.  However, this might fail if the
    building's front door isn't hooked up properly, or if there are so
    many cogs in the street already that there's no place to drop a
    new one.

    If the keyword "slow" is included, the cog is dropped elsewhere in
    the neighborhood, and will have to walk all the way to the
    building.

~toonTakeOver [all|this|<block>] [all|<zone>]
    : toon take over building.  (see cogTakeOver, above).

~startInvasion cogType numCogs
    : start a cog invasion of numCog (50, 100, etc) cogs of type cogType ("pp", "ds", etc) 

~stopInvasion : end the current cog invasion

~finishQuests : Completes all quests (except delivery quests)
~clearQuests : Resets all quest fields as if this were a new toon
~setQuestTier [<tier>] [<index>]
    Sets the reward tier and optionally index too

~getQuestTier : reports the current quest tier and index
~visitHQ : modifies all your visit and deliver quests to report to
    ToonHQ instead of whomever it used to be.

~nextQuest [<questId>] : forces NPCs to offer you a particular quest

~fix : repair avatar's quest history, maxHp, inventory, etc.

~buildings [all|where|<zone>]
    Reports the number of cog buildings vs. total buildings, and
    the target number of cog buildings, in the indicated zone (or
    overall).  If <zone> is omitted, the default is your current zone.
    "where" is a special keyword to list the distribution of buildings
    across the various zones.

~buildingPercent [<new-value>]
    Reports the overall percentage of cog buildings the leaf-blower
    system is aiming for.  If a value is specified, changes that
    percentage.

~call [<type>] [<level>]
    Calls in a cog from the sky.  If type is specified, it should be a
    one- or two-letter string describing the type of cog, e.g. pp for
    a Penny Pincher or f for a Flunky.  Level is the numeric level of
    the cog, 1 - 9.

~cogs [all|<zone>] [sync] [fly] [count=<number>]
    Reports the current number of cogs vs. the target number, in the
    indicated zone (or overall).  If <zone> is omitted, the default is
    your current zone.

    If the keyword "sync" is included, the cogs are resynchronized
    from the server.  This may be necessary if you have paused your
    client or the AI temporarily, and thus gotten out of sync, and you
    are therefore seeing some cogs in the wrong place.  (The cogs will
    eventually get themselves back into sync one at a time by
    themselves, but this process could take several minutes).

    The keyword "fly" commands all cogs (except those currently
    involved in battle) to fly away immediately.

    The keyword "count" forces the target number of cogs in the
    indicated zone (or all zones) to the given number.  Specify 'x',
    e.g. "count=x", to reset it to its default dynamic
    behavior.

~save : saves the current AI state.  Presently, this is only the set
    of cog buildings.

~oobe : toggles "OOBE" (i.e. trackball) mode.  Same as executing base.oobe().
~tex : toggles texturing.  Same as base.toggleTexture().
~wire : toggles wireframe.  Same as base.toggleWireframe().

~fps : toggles frame rate display
~fps <frame-rate> : forces a particular frame rate
~fps <percent>% : simulates the indicated performance; ~fps 50%
    degrades performance by a factor of 2.
~fps normal : restores normal unrestricted frame rate
~fps forced <frame-rate> : same as ~fps <frame-rate>
~fps degrade <factor> : same as ~fps <100/factor>%

~showcs [wall|floor|cam]
    show collision solids.

~hidecs [wall|floor|cam]
	hide collision solids.

~rogues : displays the famous "Rogues Gallery" of cogs.
~rogues [cogname]: displays just the named cog.
                   cog names are 'mm' for Micro-Manager, etc (see Suit.py)

~cogPageFull : show all the cog panels on the cog page

~for <avatar> <~magic-word>

    avatar, as if the other player had typed the magic word.  You may
    specify an avatar by doId, or if they are nearby you, by name.

    indicated minigame will be the next one chosen by the trolley
    for the next game that involves this avatar.

    optional difficulty setting overrides.
