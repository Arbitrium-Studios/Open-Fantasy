Installing and running your own servers on Win2K
------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Download the servers

	mkdir /c/toonsrv
	cd /c/toonsrv
	copy the get the most recent dev*.zip file from /p/toontown_server,
	(e.g. "cp dev_NOTAG_06_17_2002_6_36p.zip")

        (which should be equivalent to the win32 dir 
         \\dimbo\toontown_server)
        Note Roger has no access to this location yet, so make sure that
        locations holds the latest server version.

Step 2: Unzip the servers

	unzip the .zip


Step 3:  Make a file called local.par in your toonsrv directory that contains:
           
ACTIVITY_TIME_OUT_SEC=12000000
SHARD_ID=391000001:ToonsOnly1


Step 4: Install the servers as services... You must have admin privileges!

        INSTALLALL.BAT

Step 5: Install your toon.dc file.

	There is a toon.dc file that you will see in the c:\toonsrv directory
	after you install, but if you are writing AI code (or running an
	old server) you may find you need to copy a new version in from
	toontown tree:
	cp $TOONTOWN/src/configfiles/toon.dc /c/toonsrv/toon.dc
	It is imperative that these two files match, since the toon.dc file
	defines the network encoding for distributed objects. If they already
	match, you obviously don't need to copy the file there.

Step 6: Start the servers
	
        STARTALL.BAT

Step 7: Use the servers

	set server-ip in your Configrc to localhost
	set server-port to 6667
	set msg-director-port to 6665
	run the show

Step 8: Monitor the servers

	If you would like to see what is up with the servers, point your
	web browser to http://localhost:7777.

Step 9: Restarting the servers
	
	When should you do this? If you are just writing client code, then
	very seldom. If you are writing AI code, then any time you restart
	your AI server, you will also need to restart the stateserver (but
	not the others). Restarting the state server will cause all connected
	clients to disconnect.

	If you ever change the toon.dc file, or the server version number,
	You will need to restart the servers... Like this:

	STOPALL.BAT
	STARTALL.BAT

	In fact, you may find it useful to save out a script called
	"restartServer" that contains:

	#! /bin/sh
	cd /c/toonsrv/
	STOPALL.BAT
	cp $TTMODELS/phase_*/dna/*.dna .
	cp $TOONTOWN/src/configfiles/toon.dc .
	STARTALL.BAT

Step 10: Reinstalling the servers. 

	If you download new server code, all you need to do is stop 
	the old executables, copy in the new ones, and restart them. 

	If you are running new servers in a new directory, you must:

	In the old directory:
		uninstallall

	In the new directory:
		installall

Step 11: Run AI Server (if you want to)
	ppython (-d for debug)
	from AIStart import *
