class ConveyorBelt(BasicEntities.NodePathEntity):
    """
    Conveyer belt is made up of a series of contiguous MovingPlatforms,
    called 'treads'. Belt extends in +Y. You must provide a tread model
    and the length of that tread model in Y. Model should have floor poly
    that starts at Y=0 and extends to Y=treadLength. Model should match up
    with itself; two tread models aligned in X and Z and separated by
    treadLength in Y should fit together seamlessly.

    ConveyerBelt will calculate how many treads are needed to cover 'length'
    feet of belt, and instantiate that many MovingPlatforms using the
    provided tread model. Treads are then moved forward in +Y at 'speed'.
    There is an extra tread created to sit behind Y=0; this extra tread
    fills in the beginning of the belt as the last tread slides past the end.
    Once the belt has moved treadLength feet, last tread is placed at the
    beginning, and so on.

    To avoid popping localToon back to the beginning of the belt, last tread
    explicitly dumps localToon just before popping back to the beginning.
