Selections

We are often concerned with considering selections of objects, rather than
all the objects. In this instance it is important to distinguish between
two different possible situations; one in which the order of the objects is
important and one in which the order is not.

Example

It is possible to select two letters from the letters ABC in 3 ways: AB,
AC, BC. Each selection is called a combination.

However,

If the order of the selection matters then there are 6 ways: AB, BA, AC,
CA, BC, CB. Each arrangement is called a permutation.

In this case, therefore there are 3 combinations and 6 permutations of the
selected two letters.

In general, _provided_ that all the objects are different (dissimilar), then

- the number of combinations of r objects from n objects is:

nCr = n! / [(n-r)! r!]

- the number of permutations of r objects from n objects is:

nPr = n! / (n-r)!

The difference between the two formulae is a factor of r! - this is the
number of ways of arranging r dissimilar objects. For two different
letters, r = 2 and r! = 2 , i.e. for a pair of letters, then each letter
may come first or last, giving rise to two permutations for each
combination.

"""
For the cashbot mint, we have 3 mints with 20 floors each, for a total of
60 floors. On average, we want each floor to have 5 rooms. Each floor is
created by stringing together a sequence of rooms from a central pool of
rooms. The question is: how many unique rooms do we need in order to create
60 unique floors by stringing those rooms together?

We definitely want combinations of rooms, not permutations. First, an
implementation of n-Choose-r:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

def nCr(n,r):
    return factorial(n)/(factorial(n-r)*factorial(r))

n is the unknown; r is 5. We want nCr(n,5) >= 60.

>>> nCr(8,5)
56
>>> nCr(9,5)
126

We need at least 9 rooms to create 60 unique 5-room combinations.

**This isn't totally correct; we've got three types of rooms: entrances, middle rooms, and final rooms.
