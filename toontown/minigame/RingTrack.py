"""RingTrack module: contains the RingTrack class"""

"""
ringTracks are meant to be used in the ring minigame. They define a
periodic sequence of changes in a 2D position. The 2D position varies
within the range [-1..1,-1..1]

ringTracks comprise a series of ring 'actions'. (see RingAction.py) Each
action specifies a particular movement of the ring. Each action in a
ringTrack has a duration, in the range (0..1). The duration specifies the
fraction of time taken by the action wrt the entire track length.
The sum of the durations of all of a track's actions must be <= 1. If
the sum of the durations is less than 1, any time t that is greater than
the sum will be evaluated as the end of the last action.
