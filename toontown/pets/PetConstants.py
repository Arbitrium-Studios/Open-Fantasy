# This is a bboard key for a bool that, if True, indicates that we know
# that the mood of localAvatar's pet has changed in the DB. If true, upon
# opening our pet's avatar panel, we will re-query the game server to get
# updated mood info, and clear this flag from the bboard. Note that the
# flag is only used by code that runs when the pet is not instantiated on
# the client.
# Any system that knows that the mood of localAvatar's pet has changed
# should set this flag in the bboard. Currently this is only the estates
