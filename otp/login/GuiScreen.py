        GuiScreen hooks into the callbacks of DirectEntrys. Thus, GuiScreen
        is automatically notified when a DirectEntry focus item gains the
        input focus through a mouse click. The same is true for
        DirectScrolledLists.

        NOTE: between calls to startFocusMgmt and stopFocusMgmt, client
        code should not modify the following properties of DirectEntry
        and DirectScrolledList items that are in the focus list:
        -command
        -extraArgs
        -focusInCommand
        -focusInExtraArgs

        enterPressBehavior defines the default behavior for entries
        when Enter is pressed; it can be one of the values defined above,
        or simply a callback

        overrides is a dictionary of (entry, behavior) associations that
        specify exceptions to the default Enter-press behavior

        globalFocusHandler is a handler that will be called with the item
        that has just gained focus; it will be called just before the
        item's focusInCommand handler
